While this guide is meant to give Iron180 owners a comprehensive guide on how to build a 180, please keep in mind that there are many variations to some of the processes described here.

## Parts check and PCB

Before you start building the iron 180, it is imporant to take a few precautionary steps. Before you take anything apart or start building, we recommend that you double check the [parts list](Iron180PartsList.md) to ensure that nothing is missing.

### Screws

There are multiple options when is comes to screws for the back of your Iron. There are duplicate sets for color preferences as well as short and long screws. The short screws are the standard option which will not be visible when tightened, whereas the longer option allow the screws to sit flush with the bottom of the board giving it a unique asthetic appeal.

Note: If you decide to use the longer screws, you will need to be used with the included spacers before tightening. Failure to do so, might result in damage to your board.

## Gaskets and Daughterboard

Now that your board is finally diassabled, we will now focus on mounting the gaskets. We recommend you use a pair of tweerzers for this step, but you can get by with just using your hands

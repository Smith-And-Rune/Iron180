# Build Guide

***Disclaimer***

While this guide is meant to give Iron180 owners a comprehensive overview on how to build a 180, please keep in mind that there are many variations/alternatives to some of the processes described here. At the end of the day, some of these choices come to preference so do not worry if you see other induviduals building boards in a different way. That being said, if you are more of a visual person and would rather see videos, we have linked a few links to build streams below.

## Parts check and PCB

Before you start building the iron 180, it is imporant to take a few precautionary steps. Before you take anything apart or start building, we recommend that you double check the [parts list](Iron180PartsList.md) to ensure that nothing is missing.

### Screws

There are multiple options when is comes to screws for the back of your Iron. There are duplicate sets for color preferences as well as short and long screws. The short screws are the standard option which will not be visible when tightened, whereas the longer option allow the screws to sit flush with the bottom of the board giving it a unique asthetic appeal.

Note: If you decide to use the longer screws, you will need to be used with the included spacers before tightening. Failure to do so, might result in damage to your board. 

### Checking your PCB

With the advances in modern technology it is very tempting/easy to skip this step, but we high recommend that you take the time to test your PCB. Spending a few hours building your board only to find out after that something is wrong and you need to dissasemble everything is going to be a bad time. Unless you have the proper equipment to desolder, it will take you a lot longer to dissasemble than reassemble.

To test your board you will need a pair of metal tweezers and a USB-C cable. Ensure that your PCB is in an environments to minimize electrostatic discharge before proceeding and connect your PCB via the USB cable to a PC. While connected, please open a keyboard testing website (a few links below) and take your tweezer and touch the pair of pads corresponding to a key and check to see that the circuit completes and that it registers on the site.

Quick Tip: Instead of looking up after testing each key, it is faster to test every key in a row, then ensure that entire row lights up.

Note: You will not see the function key light up via this method. You will need to use a second pair of tweezers in conjunction to ensure that it registers. Our favorite is FN + 1 which will open a new tab when in chrome.

## Gaskets and Daughterboard

Now that your board is finally diassabled, we will now focus on mounting the gaskets. We recommend you use a pair of tweerzers for this step, but you can get by with just using your hands. You will notice a slight recess on the inside of both the top and bottom of the 180 which we will use as a guide for gasket application. While removing adhesive protection and attaching gaskets to a board sounds trvial, we do have few tips for quality control.

When appling the gasket, to not pull or add tension to the gasket during application. You want all of your gaskets to have an even feel across the plate while also allowing for compression, and the easiest way to do so is by slowly guiding the gasket into place over the length of the track. Also, ensure that the gasket is on the track itself and not pushed along the wall which may result inconsistent compression across the gasket.
